Lets improve Gameplay to make this more intreresting.

Character Variety

Support humanoid and anthropomorphic rigs across a wide range of heights and proportions as well as quadroped.



anthropomorphic Mechanic

On killing a target, a anthropomorphic has a 25% chance to absorb one of the victim’s abilities and gain a portion of their strength.


Lets add Four Major + Advanced Techniques
1) Gyo (Focus) – Eyes

Input: G toggle (drains 0.6/s).

Effect: Reveals In objects/traps and enemy weak points (+15% crit window). Slight tunnel vision vignette.

2) In (Conceal)

Use: Hide your next conjured trap or emitted orb.

Cost: upfront 8 Nen + 1/s upkeep (auto-drops when you attack with Ko).

Counter: Gyo/strong Zetsu tracking.

3) En (Aura field)

Input: V press/hold to pulse/maintain.

Pulse: 12 Nen burst → 12m sense ping + time-dilation on pinged daggers/projectiles (0.3s).

Maintain: radius 6→18m while held; drains 4–10/s; shows faint silhouettes.

4) Shu (Imbue)

Input: B toggle; applies to melee & thrown pickups.

Effect: weapon durability/DMG ↑; projectiles pierce 1 target; drains 1/s while a weapon is out.

5) Ko / Ken / Ryu (Offense/Defense flow)

Ko (C+LMB): one strike/guard with 100% aura to a limb → huge dmg/guard, body unprotected for 0.8s; costs 10 Nen + (AAP×0.5).

Ken (K toggle): sustained shell (Ten+Ren) → strong all-around guard; drains 1.8/s.

Ryu (Mouse wheel while holding Ken): shift 70/30, 60/40, etc. Live HUD pie shows flow.

Implementation tip: simple percentages into state.auraFlow = {head, torso, rArm, lArm, rLeg, lLeg} and multiply incoming/outgoing DMG.

Nen Type Specials (class identity)

Enhancer: Ren stacks also boost Ten/Ken DR; Ko hits leave shockwaves (small AoE).

Transmuter: give emitted shots properties (sticky, elastic, conductive). Pick 1 at a time via radial menu (Tab).

Emitter: charged blasts persist off-body longer; Volley gains slight homing during En pulse.

Conjurer: place Bound Sigil (E) that strengthens a rule (see Vows) inside 6m; visible only with Gyo.

Manipulator: tag darts/threads; on 3 tags, short Compel (0.8s) or Jam (silence).

Specialist: limited-uptime Time Distortion you already have → make it scale on Focus & Vow severity (see below) and auto-end when Nen ≤ ultMin.

Vows & Limitations (build-defining power-ups)

In menus, let players craft 1–3 active vows; each gives a multiplier and a rule:

“Only Ko strikes this wave” → +35% Ko power, Ken disabled.

“No dash this wave” → +20% all Nen damage.

“Only attack the marked elite” → +60% vs that target; –30% vs others.

“I’ll die if I break it” checkbox (endgame) → doubles the bonus but failing = instant down.

UI: simple checklist + multiplier preview. Serialize into save; show active vows in HUD.

Initiation & Talent

Initiation (fast awaken): skip tutorials but apply Leak Sickness debuff for 3 fights (–30% nen regen, random stuns on big Ren spikes).

Talent/Potential: hidden roll at creation influences training minigame speeds and stat scaling (Power/Agility/Focus per level).

Post-Mortem Nen (risk/reward)

On player death, if a Grudge bar was full (tied to vow/emotion), trigger Curse Mark on killer (DoT + slow).

Enemies can leave lingering curses too → add Exorcism side quests/consumables.

Sensory/Stealth Loop

Zetsu + crouch = super-stealth route through arenas; but you’re fragile.

En pings reveal cloaked ambushers; Gyo sees enemy aura flows (use Ryu to counter).

Training Minigames (progression that feels “Nen”)

Ren hold practice: keep a rising meter within bands for 90s (extends Ren duration cap).

Gyo numbers: flash In numbers; you must Gyo-tap the correct answers quickly.

Ryu drill: match target distributions (e.g., 70% right arm) in a timer—improves Ryu speed/accuracy.

Shu rock test: imbue a stone and break 100 others without cracking it—boosts Shu efficiency.

Each success permanently tweaks ceilings: Ken duration, Ko wind-up safety frames, En radius cap, etc.

Quantified Aura (simple, readable)

Map M.A.P. ≈ state.nenMax, P.A.P. = current Nen, A.A.P. = technique output/sec.

Use AAP caps so low-affinity uses waste aura (great for balancing Emitters spamming melee Ko, etc.).

Enemy Use & Counterplay

Some enemies telegraph Ko (glow to a limb) → punish with Ryu to the block side.

Assassin types enter Zetsu then backstab; Gyo counters.

Bosses drop Divine Script glyphs; standing within your own glyph buffs your Hatsu (Conjurer synergy).

Super-thin Implementation Sketch (drop-in)

Inputs (keep it mnemonic): T=Ten, Z=Zetsu, R=Ren (hold), G=Gyo, V=En, B=Shu, K=Ken, Wheel=Ryu, C+LMB=Ko.

State additions

state.aura = { ten:false, zetsu:false, ren:false, ken:false, in:false, gyo:false, shu:false, en:{on:false, r:0} };
state.flow = { rArm:.166,lArm:.166, rLeg:.166,lLeg:.166, torso:.25, head:.09 }; // Ryu distribution
state.vows = []; // {ruleId, strength, lethal}


Per-tick:

Leak/regen math:

base leak = 0.8; if Ten → 0; if Zetsu → 0; else subtract from Nen.

Ren on → state.aura.renMul = 1 + ramp [0.3..1.2]; add nen drain.

Ken drains, En drains per radius, Gyo drains a trickle.

Damage calc wraps limb multipliers (Ryu) and DR from Ken/Ten; Ko overrides to 100% limb.

Stealth/aggro checks read Zetsu/Ten/En.

HUD: small “Aura Modes” strip + pie for Ryu when Ken held; vow icons.

Small, flavorful extras

Bloodlust meter: builds with Ren usage; spikes cause weak mobs to hesitate.

Half-Awakened NPCs: can feel aura → react to bloodlust but can’t see aura (fun stealth tells).

Water Divination at creation to pick/confirm type (mini shader + quick outcomes).

Dual-Affinity trait (rare): learn adjacent type nodes 20% faster.
